# üñ•Ô∏è Portfolio


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/RCs8rvH/mockup-portfolio.png'> 


This is my frontend developer portfolio, created using **React, TypeScript**, and **SCSS**. It showcases sample projects with live links and GitHub repositories. The design was prepared in Figma, offering a simple and clean layout. Users can customize the color theme with pastel options (pink, blue, green, orange). Projects feature various SCSS animations and highlights using react-rough-notation.
